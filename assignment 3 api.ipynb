    "REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural approach for communication purposes often used in various web services development. It is a stateless client-server model. Web services that are defined by the concept of REST are RESTful web services. When a client makes a request via RESTful API, it transfers the representation of the state of the resources to the server. This information can be transferred in various formats via HTTP like JSON, HTML, XLT, and Plain Text, but JSON is the most common language used due to its easy readability by machines and humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is an XML-based protocol for accessing web services over HTTP. It is developed as an intermediate language so that applications built in various programming languages can communicate with each other effectively. Web services use SOAP for the exchange of XML data between applications. SOAP supports both stateful and stateless operations. Stateful means that the server keeps the information that it receives from the client across multiple requests. These requests are chained together so that the server is aware of the previous requests. Examples are bank transactions, flight bookings, etc. Stateless messaging has enough information about the state of the client so that the server does not have to bother.\n",

    "Benefits of SOAP over REST as SOAP has ACID compliance transaction. Some of the applications require transaction ability which is accepted by SOAP whereas REST lacks in it.\n",
